##Introduction
Metadata in the University of North Texas (UNT) Libraries’ Digital Collections is based on Dublin Core with the addition of local fields and qualifiers.  All records contain the same 21 fields, eight of which are required for every item.  For a record to be considered “complete,” it must have values for each of the required fields.

Optional fields should be left blank if the information is not available.

Qualifiers are required (when applicable) if the field contains a value.
